Lightweight space game, learning Kontra.js & javascript for gamedev.
Works on mobile & browser.

Keys to move the ship, or use the buttons on-screen.
No aim to the game yet, will probably add some asteroids or something simple to dodge.
Some bugs present currently also. Buttons mess up on Mobile & initial control panel doesnt load at times. 

Game hosted live @ https://www.delta-edge.com/SpaceGame
